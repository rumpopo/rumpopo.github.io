            <p>Ritam Mehta is a software engineer, among other things.</p>
            <p>What are the other things? Okay, fine, I'll tell you – he was responsible for the D.B. Cooper hijacking, the fate of the crew of the Marie Celeste, and The Losing of the Colony of Roanoake. Whoops! Don't ask him about the Teapot-Dome scandal either.</p>
            <p>Also, he writes a <a href="https://lowliftask.substack.com">weekly newsletter</a> with his friend, in which they discuss Important Business Insights and Key Takeaways From Deals. Just kidding, it's probably just some stupid musing or list. And he also performs comedy in Brooklyn when there is no Global Pandemic.</p>
            <p>Please reach out to him (fine, me) if you like anything you see here – I'm always looking for new projects and ideas to work on!</p>
